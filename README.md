# SleepDetectionSystem
 Sleep Detection for Driver
This application is designed for a computer vision. 
It was prepared using python language for the first time. 
In addition, this practice has been academically reported. 
Thanks to the OpenCV library, a warning system has been developed for the driver who yawns, keeps his eyes closed for a long time and gets too close to the steering wheel.
